# Basilisk
A Viral Loop for Programmers

What is Basilisk?
-----------------

**Basilisk** is a viral loop for programmers.  We host our source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/brainix/basilisk), continuously deploy with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/brainix/basilisk), and host our website on [Heroku](http://basilisk.us/).  We then use our website to invite our friends to collaborate on Basilisk on GitHub.

Since we deploy continuously, if you push changes to our code on GitHub, you&rsquo;ll see your changes on our live website on Heroku in minutes.
